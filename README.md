# MlRecommend

A recommendation model based on MACHINE LEARNING.
The model is integrated with ANDROID APP, 
to give proper understanding of the working of our Recommender system.
So,basically our Model uses
Machine Learning using Python tools and Libraries
Android App using Android Studio.

The dataset consists of different Laptops and its various features, two apps where created one for the seaching of a particular item other for observing the recommended items.
The recommendation works in a way as when a user searches for a particular feature of laptop on one app and
when he visits another service app automatically all similar items are recommended to him on this service app.
Knn(K nearest neighbor) algorithm is applied for the recommendation of the product.
